      <p>Hey guys! My name is Lesedi Trinity Mojakgomo. I really love music. Wanna know why? Mainly because I found a way to express myself and straighten the bendy twisty channels of my mind.</p>
      <p>Being that as it may, I made this website not only to help put my voice out into the world but to also create a space for anyone out there to also fall in love with music like I have</p>
      <p>Except for Drake fans, yall must know I've been a hater since he released "Scorpion" CORNY!!</p>
      <p>Walk with me as we go on an audio journey that not only depicts memories, feelings and moments but also makes you wanna Shazam dihh shii</p>
      <p>Just remember to let em know who put you on</p>
